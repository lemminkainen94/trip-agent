- [x] Create simple destination information retrieval
- [x] Develop basic itinerary structure generation
- [x] Build simple orchestration flow between agents
- [x] Create basic output format for itineraries

### 16. First Integration Milestone
- [x] Connect User Interface and Destination Information agents
- [x] Implement basic preference-based filtering
- [x] Create simple itinerary based on limited inputs
- [x] Generate text output of planned itinerary
- [x] Test end-to-end flow with simple use case

## Discovered During Work

### 16. Agent Improvements
- [ ] Improve attraction opening hours checking 
- [ ] Improve attraction visit duration checking
- [ ] Improve attraction visit order setting
- [ ] Improve attraction visit balance
- [ ] Pay attention to user constrains - currently it can suggest schedules which violate user time constraints
- [ ] improve map display - currently it does not mark the attractions properly and does not mark the trip route
- improve food recommendations - check food ratings and recommendations, possibly using internet check to have up-to-date information
