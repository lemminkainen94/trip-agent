# Multi-Agent Trip Planner: Project Planning

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a multi-agent system for comprehensive trip planning using Python and Langgraph. The system will leverage multiple specialized agents that collaborate to create personalized travel itineraries based on user preferences, destination information, local events, and logistical constraints.

## Agents Architecture

### 1. User Interface Agent
- **Purpose**: Manages user communication and preference capture
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Lead conversation with users
  - Extract and store user preferences
  - Manage persistent memory of user preferences
  - Handle follow-up questions and clarifications
  - Save relevant information to vector store for later retrieval

### 2. Destination Information Agent
- **Purpose**: Research and provide evergreen destination information
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Retrieve detailed information about travel destinations
  - Compile data on main attractions
  - Research historical sites and cultural context
  - Provide information about local cuisine
  - Focus on information that doesn't change frequently

### 3. Local Events & Logistics Agent
- **Purpose**: Handle time-sensitive and logistical information
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Track event schedules and venue information
  - Maintain database of opening hours
  - Calculate visit durations for attractions
  - Flag time-sensitive considerations
  - Provide updated information on seasonal activities

### 4. Itinerary Optimization Agent
- **Purpose**: Build optimized travel schedules
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Calculate travel times between locations
  - Optimize visit order for efficiency
  - Balance activities throughout the day
  - Account for operating hours and peak times
  - Create realistic daily schedules

### 5. Orchestrator Agent
- **Purpose**: Coordinate agent activities and compile final output
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Delegate specific tasks to specialized agents
  - Manage workflow and information flow between agents
  - Resolve conflicts in scheduling or recommendations
  - Generate the final trip itinerary document
  - Ensure all user preferences are reflected in output

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Langgraph**: Framework for building multi-agent workflows and managing agent interactions
- **LangSmith**: For tracing, monitoring, and debugging agent interactions
- **Vector Database**: For storing and retrieving relevant information (e.g., Chroma, Pinecone)
- **Pydantic**: For data validation and structured outputs from agents
- **TrustCall**: For secure API integrations with external services

### Memory Systems
- **Short-term memory**: For tracking conversation context
- **Vector store memory**: For semantic search of relevant information
- **Structured memory**: For storing factual information about destinations

### API Integrations
- **Maps API**: For distance and travel time calculations
- **Travel information APIs**: For accessing destination details
- **Event APIs**: For local event information
- **Weather APIs**: For forecasting during planned travel dates

## Development Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Set up basic Langgraph architecture
- Implement agent schemas and base functionality
- Create fundamental memory systems
- Develop simple orchestration flow

### Phase 2: Individual Agent Development
- Build out each agent's specialized capabilities
- Implement memory persistence
- Add domain-specific knowledge and reasoning

### Phase 3: Integration
- Connect agents through the orchestrator
- Implement feedback loops between agents
- Create conflict resolution mechanisms
- Build comprehensive memory sharing

### Phase 4: Refinement
- Optimize agent performance
- Improve response quality and accuracy
- Add error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Implement advanced features (e.g., PDF itinerary generation)

## Performance Metrics
- Quality of itineraries (completeness, feasibility)
- User satisfaction with recommendations
- System response time
- Accuracy of information
- Adaptability to user preference changes

## Evaluation Strategy
- User testing with various trip scenarios
- Comparison with manual itinerary creation
- Trace analysis using LangSmith
- Feedback collection and iteration

## Deployment Considerations
- Containerization for consistent environments
- API gateway for external access
- Monitoring and logging setup
- Rate limiting for external API calls
- Documentation for end users and developers
